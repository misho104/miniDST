# mini-DST: data format for easy analysis of ILC MC

The mini-DST provides easy access to simulated ILC data in a high-level format, which comprises e.g. ParticleFlow objects, isolated electrons, muons, taus, photons as well as jets.
The mini-DST files are readable in ROOT (as well as C++, Python, Go, Java and Julia) with the help of the corresponding LCIO shared library / dictionary.

The mini-DST can be written from the full detector simulation and reconstruction chain, from [SGV](https://inspirehep.net/literature/1091154) and from Delphes via the [delphes2lcio](https://github.com/iLCSoft/LCIO/tree/master/examples/cpp/delphes2lcio) tool.

This page offers a short introduction and a collection of usage examples. You can download this package with 
```
git clone https://github.com/ILDAnaSoft/miniDST.git
```

# LCIO
LCIO is an event data model and persistency tool on which all Linear Collider data sets are based, allowing easy exchange of data at various stages of the simulation / reconstruction chain.

For installing LCIO, and for further reading, please consult [https://github.com/iLCSoft/LCIO](https://github.com/iLCSoft/LCIO).
Prerequisite is [cmake](https://cmake.org/) and - if you'd like to read LCIO in ROOT - a ROOT installation.

### set-up for OSG (or other systems with access to /cvmfs)
To setup the a consistent set of root, gcc, cmake, python etc for compiling LCIO on the OSG (or e.g. on the German NAF), please source [setenv4LCIO.sh](setenv4LCIO.sh):

```
. ./setenv4LCIO.sh
```
Then follow the instructions on [https://github.com/iLCSoft/LCIO](https://github.com/iLCSoft/LCIO) for downloading and installing LCIO with root dictionaries.

# Reading LCIO in ROOT
You need a ROOT environment and the LCIO library.
The environment variable LCIO is set either by sourcing the setup.sh script in your LCIO installation directory, or when initialising a full iLCSoft installation.

First, write the following lines in your `.rootlogon.C`
```
{
 gInterpreter->AddIncludePath("$LCIO");
 gSystem->Load("${LCIO}/lib/liblcio.so");
 gSystem->Load("${LCIO}/lib/liblcioDict.so");
}
```
and add $LCIO/lib to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH:
```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LCIO/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

After this, any [LCIO class](https://ilcsoft.desy.de/LCIO/current/doc/doxygen_api/html/classEVENT_1_1LCObject.html) can be used in your ROOT macro.
In context of the mini-DST, you'll only need to deal with the [ReconstructedParticle](https://ilcsoft.desy.de/LCIO/current/doc/doxygen_api/html/classEVENT_1_1ReconstructedParticle.html) and the [MCParticle](https://ilcsoft.desy.de/LCIO/current/doc/doxygen_api/html/classEVENT_1_1MCParticle.html).

# A first example macro
calculating the Higgs recoil mass on Higgsstrahlung events (e+e- ---> ZH) with Z->mumu, can be found in [./examples/higgs_recoil.C](./examples/higgs_recoil.C).
A mini-DST file to try out the example script can be downloaded from [here](https://desycloud.desy.de/index.php/s/5LmrjGWqziQfMe7). 
For comprehensive SM and Higgs MC data sets in mini-DST format, please consult [http://ilcsnowmass.org/](http://ilcsnowmass.org/). 

Once you have got hold of a mini-DST file FILENAME, you can type
```
.x higgs_recoil.C("FILENAME", "OUTPUTNAME")
```
in your ROOT session to get a plot of the recoil mass.

# A second example macro
creates the same plot, but this time with the ZH signal and e+e- --->mumujj background, dominated by e+e- ---> ZZ ---> mumujj, both normalised to given values for the integrated luminosity and the beam polarisations.
By standard, ILC event samples are generated with 100% beam polarisation, for
all allowed sign combinations (usually just the two opposite-sign combinations, P(e-,e+) = (-1,+1) and (+1,-1)).
Distributions for realistic polaristaion values are then created by weighting the events - [./examples/higgs_recoil_with_bkg.C](./examples/higgs_recoil_with_bkg.C) shows you how this works.

It reads four input mini-DST files:

* [ee -> ZH -> mumuH, P(e-,e+) = (-1,+1)](https://desycloud.desy.de/index.php/s/5LmrjGWqziQfMe7)
* [ee -> ZH -> mumuH, P(e-,e+) = (+1,-1)](https://desycloud.desy.de/index.php/s/3ZqPcGPELggW4bP)
* [ee -> ZZ -> mumujj, P(e-,e+) = (-1,+1)](https://desycloud.desy.de/index.php/s/9gKznqtSGcBKBWY)
* [ee -> ZZ -> mumujj, P(e-,e+) = (+1,-1)](https://desycloud.desy.de/index.php/s/3i3tj3adfMPfPaC)

Once you downloaded the input files and the macro, you can type 
```
.x higgs_recoil_bkg.C();
```
in your ROOT session to get the resulting plot.
In this case with quite a lot of background, since no cuts are applied (apart from two muons being present).
The macro optionally takes the following arguments with the following default values:
```
const char* DIRNAME = "./", double lumi_target=900., double epol_target=-0.8, double ppol_target=+0.3, TString outname = "recoil_plot"
```
where DIRNAME is the directory which hosts the input mini-DST files.

# Now it is your turn
Try to improve the signal-to-background ratio by applying a cut on the sum of the b-likeliness values of the two jets.
For this, read in the ```Refined2Jets``` collection, check that it is there and contains 2 jets, and then get the b-likeliness values (MVA output between 0 and 1).
You find an example of how to access jets and b-tag information in [./examples/jet_btag.C](./examples/jet_btag.C).
Take a look at this (of course you can also run it if you like!) and modify your ```higgs_recoil_with_bkg.C``` such that the recoil mass histograms are only filled if the sum of the two b-likeliness values > 1.
